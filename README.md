The program was developed by Prof. Peng Fei’s group. Prof. Fei oversaw the project. Weilin Zeng and Xuechun Wang created the basic frameworks for the pipeline, optimized the sub-workflows, implemented the code and integrate them into a complete procedure. The example brain data are from Prof. Yunyun Han’s group.

# 1 Installation and start
## Requirements
BIRDS is written in Java 1.8.0 and Python 3.6.1, and links to Imaris software module. The software runs on the Fiji platform. The deep-learning prediction module requires a Python environment, and the visualization and quantitative analysis are based on Imaris. To run the program smoothly, we recommend a computer workstation running Windows 10 with at least 6 CPU cores, 128Gb of RAM and SSD disks. A configuration with 256GB RAM / 8 CPU cores or above will allow better performance. A good graphic card (e.g., GeForce RTX 2080 Ti) is recommended for implementing efficient computation. In addition, if Imaris is used for 3D digital framework mapping and data analysis, a large-capacity hard drive (e.g., 4Tb or larger) is also required to save the cached data. It should be noted that the output of BIRDS is partially determined by the parameters set, users with different experiences may obtain different results. Therefore, it is recommended to use the default parameters preset in the program.

downsample -> image preprocessing <br>
coarse -> registration<br>
precise -> visual inspection and manual correction<br>
visual -> visualization and quantitative analysis<br>
setSeg -> prediction of brain segmentations by neural network<br>

# 2 Image import and preprocessing
The task of this module is to process the imported image to generate an isotropic low-resolution image for registration with the average Allen template. First, the users need to select a cache path to download the files necessary for running the program and save all the data generated by the program. BIRDS currently only supports TIFF format image, and users can convert other formats into “TIFF” after the image datasets being imported into Fiji (ImageJ).
## 2.1 Introduction of GUI and operations
The GUI of preprocessing module is shown in the below screenshot:<br>

<img width="500" src="https://github.com/bleach1by1/figure_github/blob/master/3.png"/><br>

The GUI contains three parts: 1: Click “choose” button to set the cache file path. BIRDS will download the necessary image files (Allen Reference Atlas, average template, annotation file) and generate 5 folders as: “cache”, “generate”, “registration”, “visual” and “dl” to store all intermediate data and final outputs. 2: Importing image datasets into Fiji. If the data is not in TIFF format, users should convert it to a TIFF sequence format. This can be easily done in Fiji as well. Then, click the “choose” button to select the image (the selected image name will be automatically displayed in the text box). Coronal view is the default view in our program (starting plane at the olfactory bulb). Users can convert their images to coronal view through the “Reslice” function in Fiji. The image resolution is set in the text box. In BIRDS, X and Y correspond to the horizontal and vertical axes of the coronal plane, respectively, and Z is the direction of the AP axis. We provided test data at https://github.com/bleach1by1/BIRDS_demo. After downloading the test data file to birdsDemo folder, the test dataset “YH298.tif” can be imported in Fiji for testing the software. 3: To accurately down-sample the imported experimental datasets, which might be obviously deformed by tissue clearing, users need to identify the corresponding feature planes on the experimental data and Allen template. 
## 2.2 Operation process and description of parameter
Import the image on the Fiji platform, as shown below (first import the image and then click “choose” button to select):<br>

<img width="500" src="https://github.com/bleach1by1/figure_github/blob/master/4.png"/><br>

The software automatically pops up “Allen Reference Atlas” as following:<br>

<img width="500" src="https://github.com/bleach1by1/figure_github/blob/master/5.png"/><br>

In the third part of the “downsample” module, users need to select 7 corresponding feature planes, and fill their serial numbers in the text boxes of “ourBrain” and “atlas”, respectively. While the first and last planes may vary by different brain datasets, the choice of five middle planes is usually fixed (atlas=43, 56, 62, 78, 105), owing to the obvious anatomical features exhibited in these five planes. As shown in the figure below, we have selected corresponding feature planes in the test dataset and Allen template. The rectangular boxes show the feature regions users should pay more attention to<br>

<img width="800" src="https://github.com/bleach1by1/figure_github/blob/master/6.png"/><br>

After selecting corresponding feature planes, click “down” button to start the downsampling. This operation is usually finished within a few minutes, depended on the data size. After the downsampling is completed, BIRDS will generate and pop up two sets of images as: “outimage” and “temOrgimage” for next registration step. The generated images are shown as below:<br>

“outimage”:<br>

<img width="500" src="https://github.com/bleach1by1/figure_github/blob/master/7.png"/><br>

“temOrgimage”:<br>

<img width="500" src="https://github.com/bleach1by1/figure_github/blob/master/8.png"/><br>

After completing all the steps in image preprocessing, BIRDS pops up the “finish!” window. The isotropic low-resolution dataset generated by image preprocessing has been stored under the cache path, and all the downsampling information is stored in the “generate” folder of the cache path in form of a “dataset.xml” file.
